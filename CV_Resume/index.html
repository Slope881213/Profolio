            <h3>ANIME-STYLE IMAGE TRANSLATION USING GANS - March 2024</h3>
            <p>Course: ECE176 - Introduction to Deep Learning & Applications</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Designed a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to transform real-world photos into anime-style images using a 
                    dataset of 4,000 real images and 3 million anime images</li>
                <li>Constructed the GAN architecture, consisting of a generator to produce styled images and a discriminator to assess 
                    their authenticity, utilizing techniques such as down-sampling, residual blocks, and batch normalization for stability</li>
                <li>Executed a training regimen with alternating updates between the generator and discriminator, employing Adam 
                    optimization and backpropagation, transforming realistic images into simplified, stylistic representations</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS ON FOOD.COM RATING - December 2023</h3>
            <p>Course: CSE158 - Web Mining and Recommender Systems</p>

                <li>Engineered a recommendation system to predict user ratings for unseen recipes. Combined models through an 
                    ensemble approach, lowering MSE to 0.234, enhancing the system's ability to offer personalized recipe suggestions</li>
                <li>Utilized data from the Recipe Review Time Classifier, achieving a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.476 with a 
                    Linear Regression baseline model after processing missing values</li>
                <li>Implemented a Sentimental Model using Ridge regression, reducing MSE to 0.34 by categorizing user comments 
                    into positive, neutral, and negative sentiments</li>
            </ul>
